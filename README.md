Here I tried to create simple terminal
application to reserve one of available rooms.

Database is running under docker-container. 

1) run command "docker compose up -d" in project directory
2) navigate to public folder
3) run command "./index.php -setup-app" to setup application
4) run command "./index.php -help" to see available commands
