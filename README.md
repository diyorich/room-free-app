Here I tried to create simple terminal
application to reserve one of available rooms.

Database is running under docker-container. 

1) install docker
2) install docker compose
3) run command "docker compose up -d" in project directory
4) navigate to public folder
5) run command "./index.php -setup-app" to setup application
6) run command "./index.php -help" to see available commands
